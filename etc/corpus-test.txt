Combined action of two transcription factors regulates genes encoding spore coat proteins of Bacillus subtilis.
In vitro transcription experiments suggest that the differential pattern of cot expression of gene results from the combined action of GerE and another transcription factor, SpoIIID.
Transcription of the cotB, cotC, and cotX genes by final sigma(K) RNA polymerase is activated by a small, DNA-binding protein called GerE.
