combine action of two transcription factor regulate gene encode swarm coat protein of bacillus subtilis . in Vitro transcription experiment suggest that the differential pattern of cote expression of gene result from the combined action of Gere and another transcription factor , SpoIIID . 
transcription of the cotB , cotC , and cotX gene by final sigma(K ) RNA polymerase be activate by a small , DNA-binding protein call Gere .
